Now you will put your new skills to use with a large end-of-Phase project! This project should take 20 to 30 hours to complete.

## Project Overview

For this project, you will use exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a business stakeholder.

### Business Problem

Microsoft wants to join the fun as they see so many large firms producing original video content. hey've chosen to start a new movie company, but they have no experience making movies. You are expected to research the genres of movies that are currently performing the best at the box office. The next step is to translate your research into practical insights that the head of Microsoft's new film division can use to guide the production of particular films.

Conclusion

I will recommend Microsoft  to be release movies in May, June and November since that’s when most movies studio make the most net proft and gross revenue.
Microsoft to be releasing Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi and Drama movies since they have high viewership and profit.
Universal, Fox, and WB are the top three studios with over 100 movies each. Based on the amount of movies made, they could be potential competitors
