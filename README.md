Now you will put your new skills to use with a large end-of-Phase project! This project should take 20 to 30 hours to complete.

## Project Overview

For this project, you will use exploratory data analysis to generate insights for a business stakeholder.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### The Data

In the folder `zippedData` are movie datasets from:

Below are the datasets used in the analysis

bom.movie_gross.csv.gz'
imdb.name.basics.csv.gz'
imdb.title.akas.csv.gz'
imdb.title.basics.csv.gz'
imdb.title.crew.csv.gz'
imdb.title.principals.csv.gz'
imdb.title.ratings.csv.gz'
rt.movie_info.tsv.gz'
rt.reviews.tsv.gz'
tmdb.movies.csv.gz'
tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz'


## Deliverables

There are three deliverables for this project:

* A **GitHub repository**
* A **Jupyter Notebook**
* A **non-technical presentation**


Method used in the analysis

Data cleaning
Descriptive Statistics
Visualization.


Conclusion

I will recommend Microsoft  to be release movies in May, June and November since that’s when most movies studio make the most net proft and gross revenue.
Microsoft to be releasing Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi and Drama movies since they have high viewership and profit.
Universal, Fox, and WB are the top three studios with over 100 movies each. Based on the amount of movies made, they could be potential competitors
